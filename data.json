So experience integrating React with legacy code and understanding of using portals will be a big help here.\n\nYOU'LL NEED:\n• At least two years experience using React and a great understanding of its inner-workings and quirks.\n• To understand node, Webpack, and babel (beyond just using create-react-app).\n• To love javascript, es6+, node and all things in that world.\n• Experience and comfort developing functional components and hooks. We won't be using class-based components at all.\n• To understand reducers, context, and state and the lifecycle of react components.\n• Taste! We don't pixel-perfect mock things up, so we'll be relying on some of your great ideas to make things easy to use.\n• To be a self-starter and a go-getter.\n• To have strong interpersonal skills and be flexible, detail-oriented, professional, easy to get along with, enthusiastic and of high moral character.\n\nBONUS POINTS\n• React Native experience (yeah...we're heading down that path too!).\n• Experience managing node.js backends.\n• Experience developing cross-client email design and understanding differences in HTML layout and compatibility issues for various email clients.\n• Experience with relational data models.\n\nAll positions are full-time (remote/work-from-home) positions with salary and benefits.",
